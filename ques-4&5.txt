Question - 5: If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?
I would choose the people having some experience and skills. Rishi Sharma and Devansh Kalkhandey are two skilled friends having good skillset, are enthusiastic and energetic.
For a company to grow, I would like to choose the people on whom i can put my faith rather than appointing any unknown person. In my case, Rishi is well versed at technical side and Devansh is good at managerial side. Since I have worked with both of them and I know their strength in their respective domain.
